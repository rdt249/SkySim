Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(out) = 300 MV
I: I(GND:p) = 300 uA
Maximum value of each quantity, excluding Verilog-A modules or dangling current sources:
V: V(vdd) = 1.2 V
I: I(GND:p) = 300 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Post-Transient Simulation Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   -   To further speed up simulation, consider
          add ++aps on command line
   -   The circuit contains signals of the voltage > 10V, consider to set highvoltage=yes to get better accuracy and convergence ability.
   -   Since 17.1ISR10, the option ignorevaref is enabled by default. This will remove Verilog-A signals from the computation of references
       for convergence tolerances. This improves accuracy, but may increase transient runtime. To revert to ISR10 behavior, set the option ignorevaref=no.
